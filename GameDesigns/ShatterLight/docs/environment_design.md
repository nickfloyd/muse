# Environment Design Document - Shatter Light Chronicles

## Waking World: Lumina City

### General Aesthetic
Lumina City is a modern metropolis with advanced technology focused on neural science and cognitive enhancement. The city features a blend of sleek, futuristic architecture with some older, more traditional buildings. The overall atmosphere is clean and orderly, but with subtle signs of underlying tension and control.

## Dream World: The Dreamscape

### General Aesthetic
The Dreamscape is a constantly shifting realm constructed from Elian's fragmented memories and subconscious. It features impossible architecture, floating elements, and environments that transform based on emotional states. Physics behaves differently here, with gravity, time, and space all subject to manipulation.

### Color Palette
- Primary: Deep indigo (#4B0082)
- Secondary: Cosmic purple (#663399)
- Accent: Memory light blue (#1E90FF)
- Energy effects: Bright cyan (#00FFFF)
- Corruption: Dark red (#8B0000)

### Key Locations

#### The Nexus
- Central hub that changes as more memories are recovered
- Floating platforms connected by bridges of light
- Memory fragments visibly orbiting the central structure
- Architecture that reflects Elian's current mental state
- Doorways leading to different memory realms
- Visual representation of collected vs. missing memories
- Color scheme: Primarily blues and purples with white light accents

#### Memory Vaults
- Structured areas containing specific memory categories
- Each vault has a unique architectural style reflecting the memory type
- Core memories: Cathedral-like spaces with high ceilings and light beams
- Skill memories: Library-like areas with knowledge visibly flowing as light streams
- Peripheral memories: Intimate spaces with personal items and emotional resonance
- Color scheme: Varies by memory type, with consistent light elements

#### The Void Edges
- Unstable boundaries where memories are being lost
- Crumbling architecture that dissolves into nothingness
- Visual distortions and glitches in the environment
- Memory fragments being pulled toward the void
- Dangerous platforming sections with disappearing surfaces
- Occasional glimpses of real-world locations through tears in reality
- Color scheme: Fading from dreamscape colors to absolute darkness

#### Echo Chambers
- Areas where memory fragments naturally gather
- Acoustically unique spaces where whispers of memories can be heard
- Reflective surfaces showing different versions of past events
- Memory echoes visible as translucent figures reenacting moments
- Puzzle elements requiring alignment of reflections to reveal truth
- Color scheme: Reflective surfaces with memory blue highlights

#### The Spire
- The Architect's domain, visible from anywhere in the dreamscape
- Impossibly tall structure reaching into an artificial sky
- Constantly shifting architecture that reconfigures itself
- Interior spaces larger than exterior would suggest
- Memory light emanating from the peak
- Defensive mechanisms that activate when approached
- Color scheme: Pristine white with blue energy flowing through structure

#### Nightmare Zones
- Corrupted areas controlled by Memory Guardians
- Environment reflects fears and traumatic memories
- Distorted versions of real-world locations
- Aggressive memory manifestations as enemies
- Visual corruption spreading like infection through the landscape
- Weather effects tied to emotional intensity (storms, etc.)
- Color scheme: Dark reds and blacks corrupting the normal dreamscape colors

## UI Design Elements

### Waking World UI
- Minimalist, clean interface resembling advanced AR technology
- Rectangular frames with rounded corners
- Subtle blue glow around interactive elements
- White text on translucent dark backgrounds

## Transition Effects

### Waking to Dream World
- Screen gradually shifts from normal colors to dreamscape palette
- Ripple effect emanating from player character
- Reality appears to "dissolve" around edges of screen
- Sound design transitions from realistic to ethereal
- Particle effects of light motes rising around character

### Dream to Waking World
- Reverse of above effects
- Memory light condenses back into character
- Dream elements solidify into reality
- Brief flash of white when transition completes
- Sound design returns to normal with slight ringing effect

### Memory Flashback
- Screen desaturation except for key memory elements
- Vignette effect focusing on central memory
- Edge blur creating dreamlike quality
- Time dilation effect (slow motion for important moments)
- Audio becomes echoed and distant except for key dialogue
