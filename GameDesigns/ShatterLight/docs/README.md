# Shatter Light Chronicles - README

## Overview
Shatter Light Chronicles is a narrative-driven action-adventure game about a character who has lost his memory and fights to recover fragments while asleep. The game features a dual-world gameplay mechanic, where the player navigates between the waking world and dream world, collecting memory fragments to piece together their past.

## Core Gameplay
- **Dual-World Gameplay**: Transition between the waking world and dream world
- **Memory Fragment System**: Collect different types of memories to unlock abilities and story progression
- **Combat System**: Fight enemies in the dream world using both basic attacks and memory-based abilities
- **Narrative Exploration**: Uncover the protagonist's past through memory collection and NPC interactions

## Project Structure
This Unity project is organized as follows:

- **Assets/Scripts/Core/**: Core game systems (GameManager, PlayerManager, MemoryManager, etc.)
- **Assets/Scripts/Player/**: Player character components (movement, combat, memory interaction)
- **Assets/Scripts/Memory/**: Memory fragment system (fragment types, triggers, journal)
- **Assets/Scripts/World/**: World transition and environment systems
- **Assets/Scripts/UI/**: User interface components
- **Assets/Scripts/Demo/**: Sample gameplay demo implementation
- **Assets/Scripts/Packaging/**: Project packaging utilities

## Getting Started
1. Open the project in Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer
2. Open the MainMenu scene to start the game
3. Follow the in-game tutorial to learn the controls and mechanics

## Controls
- **WASD**: Move character
- **Space**: Jump
- **Left Mouse Button**: Basic attack
- **1-4 Keys**: Use memory abilities
- **E**: Interact with objects/memories
- **R**: Activate memory resonance
- **Esc**: Pause game

## Development Status
This is a prototype implementation of Shatter Light Chronicles, demonstrating the core gameplay mechanics and systems. The project includes:

- Complete core systems architecture
- Functional player character with movement and combat
- Memory fragment system with three memory types
- Dual-world mechanics with transitions
- Basic UI and game flow
- Sample procedurally generated level
- Guided gameplay demo

## Next Steps
To take this project further:
1. Create or acquire art assets (character models, environments, effects)
2. Design and implement full game levels
3. Create a complete narrative with dialogue system
4. Add more memory abilities and enemy types
5. Implement save/load system
6. Add audio (music, sound effects, voice acting)
7. Polish and optimize for target platforms
