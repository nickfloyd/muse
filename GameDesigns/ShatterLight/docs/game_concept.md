# Shatter Light Chronicles - Game Concept Document

## Overview
Shatter Light Chronicles is a narrative-driven action-adventure game where players take on the role of a protagonist who has lost their memory. The core gameplay loop revolves around the protagonist falling asleep and entering a dreamscape where they must battle through surreal environments to recover fragments of their lost memories. Each recovered memory fragment reveals more about the protagonist's past and gradually unveils the mystery behind their amnesia.

## Core Concept
The protagonist exists in two worlds: the waking world, where they navigate daily life with limited memories, and the dream world, where they battle manifestations of their forgotten past to recover memory fragments. The game's title "Shatter Light Chronicles" refers to the fractured nature of the protagonist's memories, which appear as shards of light in the dreamscape.

## Main Gameplay Loop
1. **Waking Phase**: The player navigates the protagonist through their daily life, interacting with characters and environments that provide context and clues.
2. **Sleep Transition**: When the protagonist falls asleep (either by player choice or as part of the narrative progression), they transition into the dream world.
3. **Dream Combat**: In the dream world, the player engages in combat with "Memory Guardians" - manifestations that protect the forgotten memories.
4. **Memory Fragment Recovery**: Defeating Memory Guardians allows the player to recover memory fragments.
5. **Memory Integration**: Upon collecting a memory fragment, the player experiences a flashback that reveals part of the protagonist's past.
6. **Awakening**: After recovering a memory fragment or failing in combat, the protagonist awakens, and the cycle begins again with new insights and abilities.

## Memory Fragment System
Memory fragments are the core collectible and narrative device in the game:

1. **Types of Fragments**:
   - **Core Memories**: Essential to the main storyline and required for game progression
   - **Peripheral Memories**: Optional fragments that provide additional backstory and context
   - **Skill Memories**: Fragments that unlock new abilities or enhance existing ones

2. **Fragment Visualization**:
   - Memory fragments appear as glowing shards of light with varying colors representing different types
   - When collected, they trigger a visual sequence showing a piece of the protagonist's past

3. **Memory Journal**:
   - Players can access a "Memory Journal" that organizes collected fragments
   - The journal visualizes connections between memories, creating a web of the protagonist's past
   - As more fragments are collected, the journal reveals larger narrative arcs
