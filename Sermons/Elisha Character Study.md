## Teaching Outline (Step 7\)

We can learn much from the life of Elisha.  What stands out the most about him is his faith not only in Elijah but his solid faith in the work that God was doing in and through him.

 Elisha, God is Salvation

### Background

Faith and salvation

**Faith** is a complete trust or confidence in someone or something \- in Elisha’s case this was the LORD

| acceptance | truth | belief  | confidence |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| conviction | hope | loyalty | fidelity |

**Salvation** is the deliverance from sin and its consequences.

| deliverance | emancipation | liberation | pardon |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| redemption | restoration | conservation | escape |

### Elisha demonstrated his faith by...

1. Dropping everything he was doing, destroying his livelihood (boiled the oxen, broke up his plow \- no going back) and following Elijah. 1 Kings 19:19-21  
2. Dealing with Ahab and Jezebel and the murder of Naboth \- he was unshaken and continued to follow Elijah. 1 Kings 21  
3. He was incredibly loyal never left Elijah’s side even though Elijah asked him to many times. 2 Kings 2:2  
4. He acknowledges that he needs God when he asks for a double portion of Elijah’s spirit. 2 Kings 2:9  
5. His faith shined brightly enough for the man and woman at Shunem to take notice. 2 Kings 4:8  
6. He was confident in multiplying the loaves (2 Kings 4:42), raising the boy (2 Kings 4:18), and filling the widow’s oil jars (2 Kings 4:1-7).

### Conclusion

God can and will do incredible things through those who have faith and walk in obedience.  This walk can be a full sprint or simply one step at a time but it it always with a God whose character deserves our full faith.  How do you walk with God, in hesitation or in expectation?
