# Genesis 30:25-43 Outline

After Jacob agrees to continue serving Leban in exchange for the striped and spotted animals God’s sovereignty overruled the wiles of both men so that He could bless Jacob. 

## Exegetical

The Author is detailing Jacob’s recognition for his need to be able to support his family while also highlighting the lengths Leban will go to exploit Jacob so that he can benefit from the blessing that God is bringing to him through Jacob. Both used wit and cunning to try to undermine the other but in the end Jacob became exceedingly prosperous.

## Theological

No matter how clever people think they are or how hard they try to deceive one another, God desires that His will be done according to His plan and He will use all things for the good of those who love Him.

## Homiletical

We should chose to do what is right according to God’s word and will instead of using the wisdom that we think we have or worrying about the consequences that may come our way from this world and those in it.
