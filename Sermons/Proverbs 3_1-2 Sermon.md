# “Following the Rules: Proverbs 3:1-2”

## **Introduction**:

### **Image**: People from the western side of the world know the first rule of international missions work or overseas travel is that you typically don’t drink the water unless it’s bottled. I was once told by a Ugandan brother in Christ that my American stomach is too weak to handle African water \- I agreed, after seeing 25% of our missions team unable to work or get up when they decided not to purse their lips when they showered.

### My wife and I had just gone through our first adoption from China and we were about to hop in a hired car with our baby girl and head to Hong Kong to catch a 13 hour flight to Seattle, WA.  The drive was long and arduous and It was incredibly hot outside so I thought, “hey I think I’ll grab an iced coffee from Starbucks.”  Despite my wifes warnings and the training an teaching that I had received I grabbed one and slurped it down\! 

### Terror struck as we sped through the narrow roads leading to our hotel in Hong Kong \- I was feeling more and more nauseous. We made it to the hotel, I was whiter than normal and sweating, my new baby girl is crying and my wife is giving me the I told you so look \+ the my child is crying look \+ the we have a 13 hour flight to endure at 5am look \- I was toast. Needless to say it went as poorly as you might imagine and at 4am we were all crying \- felt like family.

### **Need Statement**: Have you ever had that “I know best mentality?” Have you ever pushed aside God’s teaching to have it your way? How’d that work out for you?

### **Subject / Proposition**: God desires that all people follow his commandments and teaching and by doing so we will have a longer, more peaceful life.

### **Preview**: Today we are going to talk about the peace that comes from keeping and treasuring God’s commandments.

### **Connection to the Text**: Proverbs chapter 3 verse 1-2 provides a beautiful blueprint of how we, as children of God, are to handle his teaching and instruction.

### We should follow and keep God’s teaching and commandments in our hearts and by doing so we will extend the life we have and those days will be peaceful.

### **I. Peace with God**

### Jesus himself said “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full. John 10:10.” For a while after I became a Christian I wrestled with sin, selfishness and a myriad of other things.  At the time I didn’t truly realize that the goldsmith was working on me. I had no true peace, because even though I chose Jesus I was still trying to choose sin.  Eventually God won, no surprise\!  When I was fully broken after nearly losing my family I stood for the first time as a man.  Afterwards the desire for the sin I was holding so dearly vanished, God sent my family to Portland so that we could do his will and work out there and we had a complete peace about it all.

### 

### **II. Peace with others**

### As we hold fast to God's commands and use them as the foundation in how we interact with people not only will our lives be blessed but we can be doubly blessed when those around us experience his love through our abiding in his commandments.

### (**Illustration**)One night we were talking to one of my son’s again.  He was doubting his faith in God, he was rebelling, he was a teenager.  No matter how vile he decided to get with us his mom and I simply spoke truth, love, and scripture to him.  In utter frustration that while we were trusting in God’s commands about teaching and training,  he yelled “I don’t understand why you’re both being so kind and calm\!  You either must be crazy or there must be something else\!” He stormed off to bed, we prayed together, I went to pray with him.  The next morning, with tears in his eyes, he says 5 words to me “I get it, I’m sorry.”

### Does he still struggle, of course, he’s working out his salvation but my wife and I we blessed by seeing first hand how God’s teachings, when applied, impact others in our lives.

### **III. Peace with in our own lives**

### James 1:25 \- But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they do. Just as the Proverb states, keeping his perfect law gives us freedom\!

### **Conclusion**:

### When I chose to do it Burger King style (my way) and get an iced coffee; I paid for it, my family paid for it, and the folks on the plane paid for it \- as far as being a great testimony to God to myself and to others I was on the losing side.

### All throughout scripture there are examples of people who chose to keep God’s commands and there are many who did not. We can also garner those same examples from the world around us.  Finally, we also get clear pictures of the effects of holding fast or forsaking his commands in our own lives.

### Keeping God’s commands in our hearts impacts... our relationship with God

### Keeping God’s commands in our hearts impacts... those around us

### Keeping God’s commands in our hearts impacts... the peace we have in our own lives
