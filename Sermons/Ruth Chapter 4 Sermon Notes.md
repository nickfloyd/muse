**Need Statement**: ðŸ’¡Have you ever been faced with doing the right thing even though it might cause you pain along the way?

**Subject**: ðŸ¤–Godâ€™s desires that we embrace his grace

**What does it mean?**

* **v1**: City gate was where transactions happen and things are validated.   
* **v3-4: Why does Boaz only bring up the land here? (Lv 25:23)**  
* **v5:** Job of the **GO-EL** was not only to buy the land but to make sure the deceasedâ€™s legacy continued.   
* **v6:** The price is too high for him. He would have to divide the inheritance for his current family with this new one.  
  * When the **GO-EL** (the first redeemer) said NO.  He represents for us what the law could not do.  
    * He acted in a just, holy, and perfect way  
    * Just as the law could not bring Ruth into the commonwealth of Israel, it was only grace that could do it.  
    * **Eph. 2:8**  
* **v7-8:** Comes from Dt 25:5  
* **v9: We are witnesses. What does that look like today?**  
* **v11:** Become famous in Bethlehem. **Micah 5:2** prophesied  
* **v15:** 7 number of completeness   
* **v18**: **MESH-ITH BEN DAV-EED \-** Established legacy

**Conclusion**:  
**1 Peter 1:18-19 Purchased by the blood of Christ**  
Ask the Holy Spirit, is Jesus who he says he is? **MESH-ITH BEN DAV-EED**. Hey will say YES
