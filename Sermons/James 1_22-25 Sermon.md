# “Wholly devoted to God James 1:22-25”

## **22** But prove yourselves **doers** of the word, and not merely **hearers** who **delude themselves**. **23** For if **anyone** is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his \[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30290a)\]natural face in a mirror; **24** for *once* he has looked at himself and gone away, \[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30291b)\]he has **immediately forgotten** what kind of person he was. **25** But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the *law* of liberty, and **abides by it**, not having become a forgetful hearer but \[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30292c)\]an effectual doer, this man **will be blessed** in \[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30292d)\]what he does.

### **Need Statement**: 

Have you ever felt like you know what needs to be done but you just don’t feel like doing it?

### **Subject / Proposition**: 

God’s **desire** is that people are transformed by his word.  His desire is that humankind does not simply hear it but act on it as well. Abiding (to stay, to continue in) in his word will bring about immeasurable blessings in all that those who listen and act do.

### **Preview**: 

Today we are going to look at a text, that will cause us to examine our own lives.  This will act as a litmus test to determine if we are connected to the one true vine living out his will and growing or just hearing and not participating in the full-cup life he desires for us.

### **Connection to the Text**: 

 James 1:22-25 gives us a picture of what happens when we hear and do not become doers of the word and also what happens when we abide in his perfect law coming out on the other side with a full-cup life.

### **Body (Outline)**

**What does it mean?**

- v23: As professing Christians if we just sit around listening to the word and do not respond to it we are delusional \- we have made a terrible misjudgement on what it means to follow Jesus.  
- v24: If we do not respond to what we’ve heard (act on it) it will be like trying to read a book while watching a movie \- you’ll walk away not knowing what either was about.  We will walk away not absorbing the change the word originally brought in our lives.  
- v25: Keeping his perfect law and abiding in it give us liberty (or freedom)

**Is it really true?**

- Reflecting on an old adage from Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie’s novel  Mrs. Dymond (1885)  
  - “If you give a man a fish he’s hungry again in an hour. If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn.  
- Benjamin Franklin said:  
  - “**Tell** me and I forget. **Teach** me and I remember. **Involve** me and I learn.”  
- Do you remember what you learned in the 3rd grade or how to make a peanut butter sandwich? Do you know your wife’s love language or who won the last game you watched.   
- When people are in the hospital what happens to their muscles?  

**So what difference does it make to me?**

- 1 John 3:18” let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.”  
- As scripture is applied to your heart by the Holy Spirit you become freed from the chains of this world.  
- As free men in Christ we can act through the Holy Spirit and be genuine history makers doing God’s will. 

### **Conclusion**:

Finish the Edmond story

Be a doer of God’s word, wholly devoted to God.
