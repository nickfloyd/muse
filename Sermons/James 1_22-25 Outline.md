# James 1:22-25 Outline

## The Text **22** But prove yourselves **doers** of the word, and not merely **hearers** who delude themselves. **23** For if **anyone** is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his \[[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30290a)\]natural face in a mirror; **24** for *once* he has looked at himself and gone away, \[[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30291b)\]he has **immediately forgotten** what kind of person he was. **25** But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the *law* of liberty, and **abides by it**, not having become a forgetful hearer but \[[c](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30292c)\]an effectual doer, this man **will be blessed** in \[[d](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+1%3A22-25&version=NASB#fen-NASB-30292d)\]what he does.

## The Big Idea:

**What is the author talking about?**  
The author is explaining that if you hear the word and you do nothing with it or it does not change you then it’s like you looking in a mirror and when you look away you forget who you are.  But if you are transformed by the word and abide in it and live it out then you will be blessed in what you do. 

**What is the author saying about the subject?**  
If you hear the word and you do nothing with it or it does not change you then it’s like you looking in a mirror and when you look away you forget who you are.  But if you are transformed by the word and abide in it and live it out then you will be blessed in what you do.

## Exegetical(The Big Idea)

The author is explaining that if you hear the word and you do nothing with it or it does not change you then it’s like you looking in a mirror and when you look away you forget who you are.  But if you are transformed by the word and abide in it and live it out then you will be blessed in what you do.

## Theological(Universal Principle)

God’s desire is that people are transformed by his word.  His desire is that humankind does not simply hear it but act on it as well. Abiding (to stay, to continue in) in his word will bring about immeasurable blessings in all that those who listen and act do.

## Homiletical(How does this apply to me)

We should both listen intently to and act on God’s word.  If we do, we will be blessed in what we do.
