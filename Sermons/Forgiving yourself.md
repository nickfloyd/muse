Sometimes the hardest thing for us to do is forgive ourselves when we do something wrong.  We tend to be our harshest critics, so we continue to beat ourselves up even when others have long forgiven us.  Yes, repentance is important when we’re in the wrong, but the Bible reminds us how important it is to learn from our mistakes and move on. Here are some Bible verses about forgiving yourself:

God is the First to Forgive & Guides Us Through It  
Our God is a forgiving God.

  He is the first to forgive our sins and trespasses, and He reminds us that we must learn to forgive one another.  Learning to forgive others also means learning to forgive ourselves.

If Others Can Forgive Us, We Can Forgive Ourselves  
Forgiveness is not just a great gift to bestow on others, it’s also something that allows us to be free. We think that we’re doing ourselves a favor by forgiving ourselves, but that forgiveness frees us to be better people through God.

**Ephesians 4:32**  
Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.  (ESV)

**Luke 17:3-4**
