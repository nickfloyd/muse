**Need Statement**:   
💡Have you ever felt displaced by or outside of the grace of God?

**Subject**:   
🤖God’s desire is that we stick to Him and end the famine in our hearts.

### **Preview**: 

Today we're going to see what philia (friend) and store-gae (family) love?

**Connection**: Your people will be my people \- Pg 93 of Habits of Grace  

**What does it mean?**

* **v1**: Low melach \- no king  
* **v2**: Famine in **Judah** go to **Moab (\~30 miles)**  
* **v2**: Names: **Naomi**: Pleasant, **Elmalek**: God is my king, **Mahlon**: sikly, **Kilion**: disappearing, **Ruth**: friend, **Orpah**: back of the neck or skull   
*  **v5**: A dark time for **Naomi** and **Ruth**  
*  **v6**: **Naomi** is doing just as her husband would  
*  **v6**: Famine in **Moab** go to **Bethlehem**   
*  **v8**: Can you hear her say “Obea saida”: “This isn’t right\! Go home\!”  
*  **v9-14**: Sometimes human pragmatism won’t match up with God’s infinite wisdom.  
*  **v16**: Something about **Naomi** that reflected the Jewish people?  
*  **v16**: **Ruth** is a picture of God’s covenant love \- **Your people will be my people \- {{Matthew 16:25}}**  
*  **v16:** Clear indication of the Spirit of God moving in Ruth for His purposes \- **Isaiah 1:17**, **Psalm 68:5**, **Exodus 22:21-24**, **Deut 27:19** so on.  All speak of taking care of widows and orphans (many more)  
*  **v20:** Call me Mara. Her experiences like Job but she seems to be acting like Job’s wife.


**Conclusion**:  
    End the famine in your hearts and open yourself to the will of God
