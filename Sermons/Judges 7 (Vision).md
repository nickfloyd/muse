Judges 7

# ”Hard things”

## **Introduction**:

### **Image**: 

### **Need Statement**: Have you ever been asked to do something you thought to be impossible? Perhaps deal with sickness, something you’ve never done, or something else.

### **Subject:** God loves working in the context of the impossible. God desires to put us into the path of the impossible so that we can come to know that He is the one who comes through for us and work things out for his good.

### **Preview**: Today we are going to talk about what we're supposed to do with impossible or hard situations from a guy named Gideon.  

### We’re also going to take a look at 3 characteristics of the posture we should take when God asks us to do impossible things by using the example of the 300 men that were with Gideon

### **Connection to the Text**: Judges chapter 7 provides us with an incredible blueprint of an imperfect **mighty man of valor** who eventually sought to serve God in all things.


### **Judges 7:1-2**

The spring of Harod \- Birthplace of the elite forces in Israel’s army.

Already out numbered (4:1 \- Midian army had 135,000 and Gideon had 32,000 men), and what does God say? Too many Gideon\!

God wisely knows the hearts of men and he knows he wants this battle won without cultivating a sinful aire of pride.

**Judges 7:3**  
22,000 men leave “in fear” \- odds are now 14:1

**Judges 7:4-7** \- 3 characteristics  
Why where these 300 chosen?

1. **They took a posture for eternity**: These men both came and didn’t leave when given the chance. As Christians if we have eternity in mind then we will serve with abandon.  
2. **They took a posture of humility**: How were dogs looked upon in Israeli culture? So even emulating their behavior could bring the risk of being called a dog.  
3. **The took a posture of the important**: The possibility of attack by the Midianites was more important than drinking water.

Alternatively these could’ve been guys who just had bad backs and knees and couldn’t put their faces in the water \- Kinda like God was saying I want to use the old, out of shape guys that the world would laugh at or ignore.

Either way, they were available to be used by God.

**Judges 7:8**  
The odds were now at 450:1.  Incidentally these are the same odds Elijah faced in 1 Kings 18 when he took on 450 prophets of Baal.

Do you feel like the odds are stacked against you sometimes? I do. Be glad, God reveals his strength though the weak, his wisdom through the foolish \- heh. When we feel this way we need to remember that in the middle of April 32 AD our savior, our Lord, our God beat death.

**Judges 7:9-12**  
Why do you think fear gripped Gideon again?

John 3:16 reminds us that God loves us without measure. It’s so good to know that he not only recognizes when we are fearful but he graciously loves us enough to comfort us.

**Judges 7:13-14**  
Gideon found out that the Midianites were afraid of him\! Total reversal\! 

Why do you think Gideon, a man who was hiding in a wine press a few days ago is now known as a fearless warrior?

In terms of this being applied today in our lives, often times we are afraid of the demons of the enemy but the truth is if we are armored (Eph 6:10) we who name the name of Jesus Christ will be as fearless warriors to those same demons.

We don’t often think about this but if we have been moving in Jesus’ name our names are well known in hell. If you are being attacked, rejoice, that means you’re a discussion topic in hell and the Lord is with you. This truth is illustrated in 2 Timothy 3:12).

**Judges 7:15**  
After being likened to a big loaf of barley, the food of slaves and animals \-Gideon rightfully worships the Lord\!

**Judges 7:15-18**  
Paul in 2 Thessalonians 3:9 echoes this sentiment  \- “Follow me as I follow Christ”

Turns out real leadership is not saying listen to me it’s saying look on me as I do. Not saying you go but rather saying let’s go.

**Judges 7:19-23**  
This strategy illustrated   Gideon’s. understanding of the world around him. The Midianite warriors were steeped in superstition and the occult.  Secondly, they were very suspicious of each other due to the skirmishes fought between the tribes. 

What better way to kick the hornet's nest. 

I also find it interesting that they use earthen vessels to conceal the torches \- sure they were probably the most functional thing but it makes me think of how we are referred to as earthen vessels (2 Corinthians 4:7) \- when we are broken of our stubbornness and sin, God’s light shines through us confusing the enemy.

### **Conclusion**:

### God loves working in the context of the impossible. God desires to put us into the path of the impossible so that we can come to know that He is the one who comes through for us and work things out for his good.
