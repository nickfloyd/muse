# “God is in control, Hallelujah: Genesis 30:25-43”

## **Introduction**:

**Image**:   
Early in the year 1977 there was a revolution that was about to happen in the Sci-fi movie industry.  Just 6 months before the first installment of its kind was about to hit theaters a young George Lucas was looking for a toy manufacturer to build toys for his yet to be finished space opera: Star Wars.

Generally, the toy industry expects about 2 years lead time to make a new line of toys, in this case, this budding director had little time to shop the idea around.  He had been turned down by big names like Mattel, Hasbro, and Parker Brothers.  There was one who decided to take on the monumental task \- a little company in Cincinnati on the 11th floor of the Kroger building named Kenner. 

They were asked again and again to do something impossible.  Despite the fact that Lucas would never commit to cutting a check to solidify a deal, Kenner continued working and pushing to make their commitment a reality.

### **Need Statement**: 

Have you ever felt like you’ve been taken advantage of? Been mislead by someone out to only serve themselves?  How did that make you feel? Did you ever want to return the favor? **Philippians 2:3** gives us clear instruction as to how we are to treat other people.

### **Subject / Proposition**: 

No matter how clever people think they are or how hard they try to deceive one another, God desires that His will be done according to His plan and He will use all things for the good of those who love Him and for even those who might not.

### **Preview**: 

Today we are going to wrangle our thoughts around the idea that no matter what, God’s plan will continue and his will will be done despite our best attempts to control things.

### **Connection to the Text**: 

Genesis chapter 30 verses 25 through 43 chronicles the lengths one man would go to to gain a blessing through Jacob and how Jacob himself sought to control a situation that, while he was prepared for it, was well outside of his hands and securely in Gods.  

### **Body (Outline)**

### **v25-26**

We begin with Rachel giving birth to Jacob’s 12th child.  It took him 2 wives, 2 house maids and 12 children to realize that it was time for him to move out of the in-laws house.  He had already been taken advantage of several times over by Laban.

Incidentally in that culture, leaving without the parent’s blessing could lead to a family war.

**v27-30**  
We see Laban both acknowledging his desire for the continued blessing from God though Jacob and also his rooted nature of continued deception.

**v31-32**  
Jacob names his wages: speckled and spotted animals.  I am sure this probably surprised Laban, it might’ve even thrown the conman for a bit.  Laban felt like he was in control just as he had felt he had been for the past 20 years. 

**Incidentally this can apply to our lives**.  As I asked earlier: **Have you ever worked with a difficult person, perhaps your wife is giving you a hard time, or the kids just don’t seem to respect you?**  These are situations where we could have a tendency to pray, “Lord please smite these heathens\!” When we should be praying, “Lord you’ve given me endurance to run this race, help me to do it well \- change my heart.”

**v33**  
Do what is right in the Lord's sight and let him worry about the consequences.  Choose integrity and accountability over plans and schemes.

**v34-36**

### Good old Leban, at least he’s consistent. I am sure when Jacob showed up to work the next day he was wondering **who moved his cheese**. In **Matthew 6:21** Jesus stated, “for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” It’s clear where Leban has placed his heart as well as how he is leading his sons to do the same \- later on in chapter **31** we’ll see how his sons respond to Jacob being blessed with jealousy and anger.

Again, take note, **when your attempts to control something fail, how do you feel?  Do you rejoice that God is refining you and that he has other plans for you or do you get angry and jealous?** 

**v37-42**  
**Questionable breeding.** We know that Jacob had plenty experience with husbandry because he had cared for his father’s animals for 90 years and Laban’s for the last 14 years. However, much like Laban and his need to control and scheme, Jacob calls upon a familiar skill of his own and attempts to rely on his wiles to get him further.

It strikes me as an interesting thought that Jacob could’ve simply taken care of the flock and had the exact same result, according to God’s plan.  I tend to do this as well, over think things only to realize later that God is in control and I just needed to walk in obedience. 

**v43**  
He was blessed, not because of his schemes, or because of Leban’s failure and sin, he was blessed because God is in control.

### **Conclusion**:

Wrapping up the story, in April of 1977, one month before the movie was released Lucas finally decided to make a deal and as it turned out Kenner now had all of the bargaining chips.  The final deal was for every dollar made Lucas and Fox would get 2.5 cents and Kenner would net the other 95 cents\!

In the end George Lucas and Fox, like Laban, choice to not follow through on doing the right thing cost them so much more than simply striking a fair deal at the beginning.

We should chose to do what is right according to God’s word and will instead of using the wisdom that we think we have or worrying about the consequences that may come our way from this world and those in it.
