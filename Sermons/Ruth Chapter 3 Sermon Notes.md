**Image**:  üîä Growing a square foot garden

**Need Statement**: üí°Have you ever felt useless, without worth, or wonder why God would or could use you? 

**Subject**: ü§ñGod‚Äôs desires that we all are redeemed to him through the love and work of Jesus Christ \- **2 Peter 3:9**

**Preview**: Today we‚Äôre going to see that redemption always bears fruitfulness and why that matters.

**What does it mean?**

* **v1**: Naomi feels responsible for Ruth and the state they are in (**v1:9**)  
* **v2**: Explain the threshing floor  \- Spiritually, it‚Äôs a place where that which is of the Lord is separated from what is not. Where the **useful** is separated from the **useless**.  
* ‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù People  
  * David (**1 Sam 17**), Joseph (**Gen 37-39**), Daniel, Kid & lunch (**John 6**)   
* **v3**: Wash yourself (in the word) **Eph 5:25-26**   
* **v3: Rev 19:7** \- His bride has made herself ready  
*     **v4**: What‚Äôs happening here, why the seemingly secrecy? Culture\!  
* **v6**: Completely against cultural norms, not to mention a threshing floor in Bethlehem was probably not the safest place for a Moabite  
*     **v6**: Sometimes Jesus asks us to do things that seem culturally off. 

    ‚úç   **v8**: **GO-EL** \- Boaz is the next of kin after another (ch 4\) \- **Dog talking**

* **v9: Covering \- Ezekiel 16:8** | **Isaiah 4:5**   
* We should walk so closely with Jesus that we are under the cover of his grace and the dust from his sandals covers us.  
* **v11**: **ESHET-HIV-AUT** \- you are a virtuous woman  
* **Prov 31 \- ESHET-HIV-MIM-SA \-** A virtuous woman who can find?  
* **v13**: Boaz accepts the proposal  
* **v17**: 6 measures \- 6 days of creation to bring it to its fullness, no rest until the covenant has been made. 

**Conclusion**:  
Grow where God has planted you.  Bear fruit because you are redeemed.
