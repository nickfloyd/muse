Judges 15 (**Samson burns)**

**v1-3:** He’s angry.

**v4:** Probably Jackals (Travel in packs)

v4-5: His wife was initially afraid of getting burned (14:15)

v7-8: “He smote them hip and thigh” nkjv \- “from top to bottom”

v8: He gets out of Dodge

v9-11: **Samsons Rule**: Do unto them as they did to me\!  
	**God’s Rule:** As you want others to do, you do to them (Luke 6:31)

v12-13: Only account of israel drawing an army to capture one of their own

v14-15: 1Cor 1:27 Use the foolish to confound the wise  
	Shamgar 600 w/ ox goad  
	Samson 1000 w/ jawbone  
	David 1 w/ rock

v16-17: Ramath-lehi: “Jawbone Heights” (God later renames)

V19: God’s grace abounds.

**Image:** 

**Need**: Have you ever wanted to get “back” as someone for doing you wrong?

**Subject**: God desires that people seek him instead of their own vengeance and let him worry about setting records right. 

**Preview / Connection:** In the text we’re about to read we’re going to see an example of a man consumed by anger and missed expectations who chooses to follow his own rules. Yet God will still use him in mighty ways and he will still be considered a “Giant of the Faith” (**Heb 11:32**)

**Conclusion**:

Don’t forget: there was 20 years of peace  
Don’t only remember Samson for his failings but also for his broken and contrite heart and love of God \- especially near the end of his life

**Rise up by Andrew Peterson**

**We must know and accept that God will handle others that do us wrong as well as handle us as we do wrong to others \- all with the heart of drawing us into repentance and into Him\!**
