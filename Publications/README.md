REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architecture for distributed hypermedia systems. The World Wide Web is possibly the best known implementation of this architecture style. The term "REST" was coined and described by a dissertation written by Roy Fielding in 2000. This article covers the architecture which contains four basic constructs that address common concerns such as: scalability, generalized interfaces and resources, and patternized approaches for manipulation of resources.

## OAuth 2nd Party Extension

This Authentication protocol is an extension of the OAuth 1.0 protocol which enables websites or applications (Consumers) to access Protected Resources from a web service (Service Provider) via an API, without requiring Users to disclose their Service Provider credentials to the Consumers. More generally, OAuth creates a freely-implementable and generic methodology for API authentication.

This extension’s intent is to provide a pattern that will support the usage concepts of Trusted Consumer applications, Multi-Tenant / multi-Users with multi-personas. As well as provide a token based trust for consumer applications that have a preexisting trust established (i.e. the consumer is a tenant of the service provider and the consumer’s users have established a trust with the service provide via the consumer).

This enables the usage of many security measures from the OAuth Protocol while allowing the applications written by those parties accept credentials directly. Since the user already "trusts" the Consumer / Organization who wrote the application encoding and accepting credentials directly ensures seamless integration.
